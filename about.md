If you've found this page, you're reading my blog - I guess that would mean it has succeeded in its purpose.

# What's the point?
The idea of this site is to share my thoughts and ideas, in a format longer than a Tweet, but hopefully more concise than a book. There's no guarantee that it will be updated frequently, but it's here for now and I hope whoever might find it is entertained by it at the very least.

# But who are you?
Now the other thing I bet you're wondering is who I actually am. At the time of writing this post, I'm an 18 year old from a small town near Sheffield in England.

I work as an Associate Engineer at Pendo.io, a software startup headquartered in Raleigh NC, and I've been a full stack web developer for nearly 3 years now.

The majority of my work involves Ruby on Rails and frontend JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS and React, so expect writing around those topics to appear here more often than not.
I enjoy climbing, lifting weights, and video games - it's not all about work!
